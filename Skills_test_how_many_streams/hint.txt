Here are some hints to finding the number of streams. 

Hint #1:

If the instructor has covered the built in projection system, 
and what each projection does.. start there. 

What projection tracks the presence of streams? 

Hint #2:
Take a look at the Generate_random_test_data.py script. 

if the solution to this challenge depends on a particular projection being ran, 
then that code will verify that the projection is running before it appends data. 

You can get the projection name there, and read events from it to create an
iterator of all streams present, and then increment a counter by iterating through 
the result.
